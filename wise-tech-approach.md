# The Wise Tech Approach: A Contrast with Traditional Complex Software Approaches

## Traditional Complex Approach: CICD + DevOps + DevSecOps as Disconnected Chains

### CICD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)
- **Focus:** Automating the integration and deployment of code.
- **Challenges:**
  - Often operates in isolation, focusing purely on the mechanics of code deployment.
  - Limited feedback loops with other areas like security, operations, or user experience.
  - May lead to rapid deployment of changes without considering the broader implications.

### DevOps
- **Focus:** Bridging development and operations to improve collaboration and deployment speed.
- **Challenges:**
  - Can become a siloed practice that prioritizes speed over quality and user impact.
  - Security and user feedback might be an afterthought, leading to reactive rather than proactive measures.
  - Complex toolchains and processes can create friction and increase cognitive load for developers.

### DevSecOps
- **Focus:** Integrating security into DevOps practices.
- **Challenges:**
  - Often tacked onto existing DevOps processes, leading to fragmented workflows.
  - Security becomes a compliance checkbox rather than a deeply integrated part of the development process.
  - The disconnect between development, operations, and security can lead to vulnerabilities and inefficiencies.

## The Wise Tech Approach: Integrated and End-to-End

### End-to-End Developer Process
- **Focus:** Developers are involved in the entire lifecycle, from initial design to deployment, with a strong emphasis on quality, security, and user impact.
- **Key Principles:**
  - **Process Improvement:** Continuous refinement of the development process, ensuring that lessons learned from past projects are applied.
  - **Knowledge Capitalization:** Developers work closely with other teams (including security and operations) to build on collective knowledge, avoiding silos.
  - **Resilience Behavior:** Code is developed with resilience in mind, considering potential failures and how to recover gracefully.

### End-to-End Platform Process
- **Focus:** Platform engineers design and maintain systems that are resilient, scalable, and user-focused.
- **Key Principles:**
  - **System Resilience:** Platforms are built to withstand and adapt to failures, with continuous monitoring and proactive improvements.
  - **Scalability and Efficiency:** The platform is designed to grow with demand without sacrificing performance or quality.
  - **User-Centric Design:** The platform's architecture and services are designed to enhance the end-user experience, prioritizing accessibility, reliability, and simplicity.

### Feedback Process Wrapped Around Technology Consumers
- **Focus:** Continuous feedback from technology consumers (end-users) is integrated into the development and platform processes.
- **Key Principles:**
  - **Purposeful Technology:** Feedback loops ensure that technology is serving users effectively, rather than complicating their lives.
  - **Human Connection:** Feedback is not just about metrics but also about how technology impacts human relationships and quality of life.
  - **Simplicity:** The feedback process helps identify areas where technology can be simplified, reducing friction and enhancing usability.
