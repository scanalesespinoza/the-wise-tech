# The Wise Tech

## Vision
The Wise Tech aims to give back to society by helping people use technology in the right way, with a focus on improving life quality and simplifying interactions. Our goal is to enable individuals to focus on their relationships with friends and loved ones.

## Core Ideas
- **Purposeful Technology:** Technology should serve people, not the other way around.
- **Simplification:** Technology should simplify life, making it easier to focus on what truly matters.
- **Quality of Life:** Tools and platforms developed should improve the overall quality of life.
- **Human Connection:** Foster human connection by reducing technological distractions and promoting meaningful interactions.

## Foundational Principles
The base of The Wise Tech is about evolving software technology into progressive and incremental stages, avoiding pitfalls, and preserving past learnings. The cornerstones of this approach include:
- **Process Improvement:** Continuously refining and optimizing processes to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Knowledge Capitalization:** Leveraging accumulated knowledge to avoid repeating past mistakes and to build on previous successes.
- **Resilience Behavior:** Developing technology that is robust, adaptable, and capable of recovering from setbacks.

## Self-Awareness and Reflection

At The Wise Tech, we believe that self-awareness is key to making meaningful changes in how we interact with technology. We invite you to reflect based on your role:

### For Software Technology Consumers

- **Impact on Relationships:** How does technology currently impact your relationships with friends and loved ones?
- **Simplicity or Complexity:** Do you feel that technology simplifies your life or adds more complexity?
- **Mindful Use:** What areas of your life could benefit from a more mindful use of technology?

### For Software Developers

- **Code Quality and Impact:** How does the quality of your code affect the end-users? Are you considering the long-term maintainability and ethical implications of your work?
- **Innovation vs. Stability:** Are you balancing innovation with the need for stable, reliable software? How do you decide when to push boundaries and when to build on established foundations?
- **Collaboration and Learning:** How are you contributing to collective knowledge in your team? Are you learning from past projects and applying those lessons to improve future work?

### For Platform Engineers

- **System Resilience:** How resilient are the platforms you build? Are they designed to withstand failures and adapt to changing conditions?
- **Scalability and Efficiency:** Are your platforms designed to scale efficiently without sacrificing performance? How do you balance the need for immediate performance with long-term sustainability?
- **User-Centric Design:** How does your work impact the end-user experience? Are the platforms you design and maintain making technology more accessible and reliable for others?

Take a moment to reflect on these questions in the context of your role. If you find areas where improvements can be made, consider how you can align your work more closely with the principles of The Wise Tech.
