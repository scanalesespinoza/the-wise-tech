- **Disconnected Processes:** Each stage operates in isolation, leading to potential inefficiencies and a lack of holistic alignment with user needs.

## The Wise Tech Approach: Integrated End-to-End Process

### 1. End-to-End Developer Process
```
+--------------------------------------+
|   Developer:                         |
|   - Design                           |
|   - Development                      |
|   - Security Considerations          |
|   - Deployment                       |
+--------------------------------------+
```

### 2. End-to-End Platform Process
```
+--------------------------------------+
|   Platform Engineer:                 |
|   - System Design                    |
|   - Resilience & Scalability         |
|   - Monitoring & Optimization        |
|   - User-Centric Design              |
+--------------------------------------+
```

### 3. Feedback Loop from Technology Consumers
```
+--------------------------------------+
|   Technology Consumers:              |
|   - Provide Feedback on Usability    |
|   - Report Issues & Improvements     |
|   - Impact on Quality of Life        |
+--------------------------------------+
           â†‘
           |
+--------------------------------------+
|           Integrated Feedback Process |
|   - Developers & Platform Engineers   |
|   - Continuous Improvement            |
+--------------------------------------+
```

- **Integrated Process:** All stages are interconnected, with a continuous feedback loop that ensures alignment with user needs and promotes ongoing improvement.

## Summary
- The **traditional approach** is characterized by isolated processes, which can lead to disjointed workflows and missed opportunities for holistic improvements.
- The **Wise Tech approach** emphasizes an integrated, end-to-end process where developers, platform engineers, and technology consumers are all connected through a continuous feedback loop, ensuring that the technology serves its intended purpose effectively.
